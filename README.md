# volume

Volume control extension for Firefox.

Currently not supported on sites without `<audio>` or `<video>` elements.

Icon sourced from [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/).

## TODO
- Change icon when volume changes
- Save for certain sites
- Figure out how to dynamically add audio/video sources
